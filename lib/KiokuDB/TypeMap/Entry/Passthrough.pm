=head1 NAME

KiokuDB::TypeMap::Entry::Passthrough - A typemap entry of objects that will be
serialized by the backend.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    KiokuDB::TypeMap->new(
        entires => {
            'Value::Object' => KiokuDB::TypeMap::Entry::Naive->new,
        },
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This typemap entry delegates the handling of certain objects to the backend.

A prime example is L<DateTime> being handled by
L<KiokuDB::Backend::Serialize::Storable>. L<DateTime> has efficient L<Storable>
hooks, and does not refer to any domain objects, so it is safe to assume that
it can just be passed through for serialization.

=item intrinsic

If true the object will be just left in place.

If false, the object will get its own ID and entry, and the object will be in
the C<data> field of that entry.
